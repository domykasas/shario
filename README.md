# Shario - P2P File Sharing Application

Shario is a cross-platform peer-to-peer file sharing application with real-time chat capabilities. Built with Go, libp2p, and Fyne, it provides secure, decentralized file sharing without the need for central servers.

## Features

- **P2P File Sharing**: Direct file transfers between peers with real-time progress tracking
- **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging with connected peers
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatic peer discovery using mDNS (local network) and DHT (internet)
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end encryption using libp2p's secure transport
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **User-friendly GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface built with Fyne
- **Identity Management**: Cryptographic identity with customizable nicknames

## Requirements

- Go 1.20 or higher
- libp2p dependencies (automatically handled by Go modules)
- Fyne UI dependencies

```

### Build for Different Platforms

**Build for Windows (from any platform):**
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o shario.exe .
```

**Build for macOS (from any platform):**
```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o shario .
```

**Build for Linux (from any platform):**
```bash

```

## Usage

### First Launch
1. Run the application: `go run .`
2. Set your nickname in the "Your Identity" section (type new name and click "Update")  
3. The application will automatically start discovering peers on your local network
4. To test with multiple instances, open additional terminals and run `go run .`

### Connecting to Peers
- Peers on the same local network will be discovered automatically via mDNS
- For internet-wide discovery, peers connect through the DHT network
- Connected peers will appear in the "Peers" tab

### Sending Files
1. Go to the "Peers" tab
2. Click "Send File" next to a connected peer
3. Select the file you want to send
4. The transfer will appear in the "Transfers" tab with real-time progress
5. Use "Cancel" button to stop transfers, "Open" button to view completed files

### Receiving Files
- When someone sends you a file, you'll see a dialog asking if you want to accept it
- Click "Yes" to accept the transfer
- Accepted files are saved to your Downloads/Shario folder
- Transfer progress is shown in the "Transfers" tab with real-time updates
- Use "Open" button to open received files or their containing folder

### Chatting
1. **Global Chat**: Automatically available when you start Shario
   - All connected users join the global chat automatically
   - Start typing immediately - no setup required
   - Messages are visible to all connected peers
2. **Direct Chat**: Click "Chat" next to a specific peer for private messages
3. Type messages and press Enter or click "Send"
4. Chat history is maintained for the session

## Configuration

### Identity Storage
Your cryptographic identity is stored in:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.shario/identity_[PID].json` (unique per instance)
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.shario\identity_[PID].json`

Note: Each running instance creates a unique identity file based on its process ID, allowing multiple instances to run simultaneously for testing.

### Download Directory
Files are downloaded to:
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/Downloads/Shario/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\Shario\`

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **`main.go`**: Application entry point
- **`internal/app/`**: Main application controller
- **`internal/network/`**: P2P networking using libp2p
- **`internal/transfer/`**: File transfer management
- **`internal/chat/`**: Real-time chat functionality
- **`internal/identity/`**: Identity and key management
- **`internal/ui/`**: User interface using Fyne

## Security

- All peer communications use libp2p's secure transport layer
- Each user has a unique cryptographic identity based on RSA key pairs
- File transfers are encrypted end-to-end
- No central server required - fully decentralized

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure all system dependencies are installed
- Check that Go version is 1.20 or higher
- Verify CGO is enabled: `go env CGO_ENABLED`

**No peers discovered:**
- **Most Common**: You need to run multiple Shario instances to see peers
  - Open 2+ terminals and run `go run .` in each
  - Each instance creates a unique identity automatically
  - Peers should discover each other within 10-15 seconds
- **Network Issues**: 
  - Check firewall settings - ensure the application can accept incoming connections
  - Verify you're on the same network as other Shario users (for mDNS discovery)
  - Wait 30-60 seconds for initial DHT discovery
- **Manual Connection**: Use "Connect to Peer" button with peer's multiaddress

**File transfers failing:**
- Ensure both peers have stable network connections
- Check available disk space
- Verify firewall allows peer-to-peer connections

**GUI not displaying correctly:**
- Update graphics drivers
- Try running with software rendering: `FYNE_THEME=dark ./shario`

### Debug Mode
Run with debug logging:
```bash
export LIBP2P_DEBUG=1
./shario
```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
go test ./...
